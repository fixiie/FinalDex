When it makes friends with people, it may show them the most delicious dreams it's ever eaten.","As a matter of course, it makes anyone it meets fall asleep and has a taste of their dreams. Anyone having a good dream, it carries off.","","","","","Six of them together form a full-fledged Pokémon. It's often hunted by Crabrawler, but uses psychokinesis to drive it off.","When the time comes, one of its three heads falls off. Before long, the fallen head grows into an Exeggcute.","The skull it wears on its head is that of its dead mother.

It doesn't calm down until its opponent has burned to ash.","One solid blow from its horns is enough to split apart a large tree. Its greatest rival in Alola is Vikavolt.","Although it's known to be a fierce Pokémon, Tauros in the Alola region are said to possess a measure of calmness.","Its reckless leaps make it easy pickings for predators.

Following protective regulations, there is now an overabundance of them.","With its astonishing capacity for metamorphosis, it can get along with anything. It does not get along well with its fellow Ditto.","Current studies show it can evolve into an incredible eight different species of Pokémon.","Blending in with the water and erasing all signs of its presence, it patiently waits for its prey, fish Pokémon.","When its fur stands on end, that's a sign it's about to give off a jolt of electricity.

When they're angry, their odor smells sour.","In battle, it throws punches with all four arms. The power of each individual blow is piddly, so it aims to win by quantity rather than quality.","Some fishermen weave its sturdy thread into nets to catch fish Pokémon.","It spins thread from both its rear and its mouth. Then it wraps its prey up in thread and sips their bodily fluids at its leisure.","Silent and swift in its four-winged flight, it bites down on its prey before they realize what's happening. In a heartbeat, it drains their blood.","It lives in the depths beyond the reach of sunlight. It flashes lights on its antennae to communicate with others of its kind.","This Pokémon flashes a bright light that blinds its prey.

It's a particular favorite among elderly people.","It's the leader of Poliwag and Poliwhirl.

So on rainy days, this Pokémon prefers to stay put in its nest.","","","","","","Porygon was updated to a new version in readiness for planetary development. But that dream remains unrealized as yet.","","It draws symbols all over the place to mark its territory. In towns with many Smeargle, the walls are covered in graffiti.","","","","This Pokémon is constantly fighting with Togedemaru that try to steal its electricity.

When its gemstone eyes begin to glow with a sinister shine, it's believed that Sableye will steal people's spirits away.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","If they scent the faintest trace of blood, they rush to attack en masse. When alone, they're rather cowardly.","It has a sad history. In the past, its dorsal fin was a treasured foodstuff, so this Pokémon became a victim of overfishing.","It shows off by spraying jets of seawater from the nostrils above its eyes. It eats a solid ton of Wishiwashi every day.","Its immense size is the reason for its popularity. Wailord watching is a favorite sightseeing activity in various parts of the world.","","","If the fire burning within its shell goes out, it will die. Those who wish to raise one in their home must always keep something flammable at hand.","","","Each and every Spinda has a slightly different configuration of spots. There are collectors who enjoy the tiny differences in their spot patterns.","As it digs through the sand, its giant jaws crush any rocks that obstruct its path. It builds a funnel-shaped nest.","To help make its wings grow, it dissolves quantities of prey in its digestive juices and guzzles them down every day.","This Pokémon hides in the heart of sandstorms it creates and seldom appears where people can see it.","","","","","","","","","Its slippery body is hard to grasp, so much so that there are festivals where people compete to see how many they can catch barehanded.","Sighting Whiscash leaping from the water is believed to herald an earthquake.","","","","","","","","","Although unattractive and unpopular, this Pokémon's marvelous vitality has made it a subject of research.","It lives at the bottom of clear lakes. In times of war, it shows itself, which soothes people's minds and hearts.","Its form changes on its own, due to its cells' sensitive reactions to temperature and humidity.","","","","","","","","Although it's said to bring disaster, in actuality, this Pokémon possesses a calm disposition and warns people of any crises that loom.","","It can only survive in cold areas. It bounces happily around, even in environments as cold as -150 degrees Fahrenheit.","Its prey is instantaneously frozen stiff by the cold air it exhales from its huge mouth. While they're in that frozen state, it gobbles them up.","","","","","","","It was fortuitously discovered during a deep sea expedition. Its teeth have atrophied, so it now survives on microscopic organisms it sucks up.","Loving couples have a soft spot for this Pokémon, so honeymoon hotels often release this Pokémon into their pools.","With its steel-hard stone head, it headbutts indiscriminately. This is because of the stress it feels at being unable to fly.","They lurk deep within caves—motionless, neither eating nor drinking. Why they don't die is not known.","It flies around on its wings, which have grown in at last. In its happiness, it gushes hot flames, burning up the fields it passes over.","With magnetic traction, it pulls its opponents in close. When they're in range, it slashes them with its rear claws.","It adores magnetic minerals, so it pursues Nosepass at speeds exceeding 60 mph.","A linkage of two Metang, this Pokémon can perform any calculation in a flash by utilizing parallel processing in its four brains.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","In rock layers where Cranidos fossils are found, the fossilized trunks of trees snapped in two are also often found.","Records exist of a revived fossil that evolved into Rampardos. It proceeded to escape and then destroy a skyscraper with a headbutt.","This Pokémon lived in primeval jungles.

Their fossils have been found together—seemingly from after they'd fought to the finish.","","","","","","","","","","","Purple mucus sticks to the hands of anyone who touches it. Take care, as the substance is troublesome to wash off.","Plankton, invisible to the naked eye, is its main food source.

This liquid is similar in composition to human sweat.","","It's too small to lay eggs yet. As a surrogate, it searches out round white stones.","","","It skulks in caves, and when prey or an enemy passes by, it leaps out and chomps them. The force of its attack sometimes chips its teeth.","Shiny objects are its passion. It can be found in its cave, scarcely moving, its gaze fixed on the jewels it's amassed or Carbink it has caught.","The protuberances on its head serve as sensors. It can even detect distant prey.","When it finds something that looks like it might be edible, it goes right ahead and swallows it whole. That's why it gets fatter day by day.","It's tough enough to run right through the night, and it's also a hard worker, but it's still just a youngster.","They can detect the species of a living being—and its emotions—from over half a mile away.

With every thud, thunder roars and electric sparks shower all around.","From its arm, it launches fireballs hotter than 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit. Its arm starts to melt when it fires a whole barrage.","","","The younger they are, the more they smell like fresh grass. With age, their fragrance takes on the odor of fallen leaves.","It freezes its fur into icicles, spiky and sharp, and tackles its prey.","","","Its program was modified to facilitate extra-dimensional activities, but that led to noticeably strange behavior.","","The main body controls three mobile units called Mini-Noses, which it maneuvers to catch prey.","","The soul of a woman lost on a snowy mountain possessed an icicle, becoming this Pokémon.

When one Archeops had the prey cornered, another would swoop on it.","It gorges on trash until its stomach is full. Then it belches toxic gas.
