All of the cells throughout its body are being rebuilt in preparation for evolution.","Its wings are covered in toxic scales. If it finds bird Pokémon going after Caterpie, Butterfree sprinkles its scales on them to drive them off.","","","","","","","Its incisors grow continuously throughout its life. If its incisors get too long, this Pokémon becomes unable to eat, and it starves to death.","People say that it fled from its enemies by using its small webbed hind feet to swim from island to island in Alola.","Its reckless nature leads it to stand up to others—even large Pokémon—if it has to protect its territory.","Carrying food through Fearow's territory is dangerous. It will snatch the food away from you in a flash!","By dislocating its jaw, it can swallow prey larger than itself. After a meal, it curls up and rests.","The latest research has determined that there are over 20 possible arrangements of the patterns on its stomach.","Its nature is to store up electricity. Forests where nests of Pikachu live are dangerous, since the trees are so often struck by lightning.","As electricity builds up inside its body, it becomes more aggressive. One theory is that the electricity buildup is actually causing stress.","It lives in areas of limited rainfall. When danger approaches, it curls up into a ball to protect its soft stomach.","Its claws and horns often break off. The broken claws and horns can be used to carve plows for tilling farm fields.","","","","","","","They're popular, but they're rare. Trainers who show them off recklessly may be targeted by thieves.","It can't help but hear a pin drop from over half a mile away, so it lives deep in the mountains where there aren't many people or Pokémon.","Its beautiful tails have made it very popular. However, if it's not brushed diligently, it will be a mass of tangles before you know it.","It is vindictive and relentless by nature. Those who cross it even once will be cursed for a thousand years, along with their descendants.","Recordings of Jigglypuff's strange lullabies can be purchased from department stores. These CDs can be found near the bedding area.","Thanks to its bouncy body and fine fur, this Pokémon is sought after. Holding one in your arms while you sleep feels great.","It has no eyeballs, so it can't see. It checks its surroundings via the ultrasonic waves it emits from its mouth.","Every once in a while, you'll see a Golbat that's missing some fangs. This happens when hunger drives it to try biting a Steel-type Pokémon.","","","","Whether it's due to a lack of moisture or a lack of nutrients, in Alola the mushrooms on Paras don't grow up quite right.","The bug is mostly dead, with the mushroom on its back having become the main body. If the mushroom comes off, the bug stops moving.","","","It travels through tunnels that it digs underground. It hates sunlight, so it comes out only after the sun goes down.","While the three of them normally get along splendidly, on rare occasions a huge fight will break out over which head gets to eat first.","When visiting a junkyard, you may catch sight of it having an intense fight with Murkrow over shiny objects.","Although the jewel on its forehead appears to be a different color than those of Alolan Persian, it's mostly made of the same material.","Using psychokinesis gives it a headache, so it normally passes the time spacing out and doing as little as possible.","Even fast-swimming fish Pokémon can be disabled by Golduck. It brings them to a standstill and seizes them.","The smallest of things could cause it to lose its temper. Because it doesn't hold in its stress, this Pokémon can live a long time.","It will never forgive opponents who have angered it. Even after it has beaten them down until they can't move, it never ever forgives.","While it's quite friendly toward humans once it's grown used to them, in the wild it must be quite fierce to defend its territory from Rockruff.","Legends tell of its fighting alongside a general and conquering a whole country.","Despite the danger, it wants to come up on land. So it does its best to waddle along, but when an enemy finds it, it rushes back to the water.","Although it has become capable of living on land, it spends its time in the water, where its prey, fish Pokémon, are plentiful.","It's quite a gifted swimmer, even among Water-type Pokémon, but it normally spends its time on land.","It uses various psychic powers even while it's sleeping, so you can't tell whether or not it's awake.","It stares at a silver spoon to amplify its psychic powers before it lets loose. Apparently, gold spoons are no good.","Alakazam uses its psychic powers to make the spoons it carries. Each spoon is an original that there's only one of in the whole world.","Once this Pokémon has gained enough confidence and muscle from training with its friends, it challenges Makuhita to a battle.","When it encounters an enemy that's truly mighty, this Pokémon removes the power-save belt from its waist and unleashes its full power.","It grasps its opponents with its four arms and twists them up in an intricate hold. People call it “the Machamp special.”","","","","It drifts through the sea searching for prey. Its poisonous tentacles break off sometimes, but after a while, they grow back.","It fires off ultrasonic waves from its red orbs to weaken its prey, and then it wraps them up in its 80 tentacles.","Geodude that have lived a long life have had all their edges smoothed out until they're totally round. They also have a calm, quiet disposition.","It climbs up cliffs as it heads toward the peak of a mountain. As soon as it reaches the summit, it rolls back down the way it came.","When Golem grow old, they stop shedding their shells. Those that have lived a long, long time have shells green with moss.","","","There are some places where Slowpoke is worshiped because of a long-standing belief that whenever Slowpoke yawns, it rains.","Spacing out is basically all it does. It turns back into Slowpoke if its tail, along with Shellder, breaks off.","It's frequently the cause of power outages, which is why some power plants send out electrical signals that it can't stand.","Delicate equipment can malfunction in areas inhabited by Magneton, which send out mysterious electrical signals.","","","","It has always been supposed that Seel live only in cold seas. Their having shown up in Alola is a mystery.","It swims through the ocean at a speed of eight knots, searching for Pokémon that will become its prey. It's especially fond of Wishiwashi.","It was born from sludge on the ocean floor. In a sterile environment, the germs within its body can't multiply, and it dies.","Their food sources have decreased, and their numbers have declined sharply. Sludge ponds are being built to prevent their extinction.","The sand that accumulates inside its shell eventually becomes a pearl. But the pearl gets in the way, so it spits it out and discards it.","If areas of Cloyster's very hard shell get damaged, those areas swell, gradually growing into large sharp spikes.","It's said that gas emanating from a graveyard was possessed by the grievances of the deceased and thus became a Pokémon.","On moonless nights, Haunter searches for someone to curse, so it's best not to go out walking around.","You can hear tales told all over the world about how Gengar will pay a visit to children who are naughty.","","It can be spotted near recreational facilities, intending to eat the pleasant dreams of children who enjoyed themselves there that day.","In Alola, Komala is Hypno's main target. It rarely harms people.","","","","","Six of them form a single Pokémon. Should one of the six be lost, the next morning there will once more be six.","It engages its enemies using psychic powers. Each of its three heads fires off psychokinetic energy, tripling its power.","At night, it weeps loudly for its dead mother, but those cries only attract its natural enemy—Mandibuzz.","It throws bones at Mandibuzz to knock it down. It's thought that Marowak is trying to avenge its parent.","","","It checks out whatever's around it by licking everything. If you don't clean off a spot where it's licked you, you'll break out in a rash!","","","","","It seems that other Pokémon's efforts to take its delicious, nutritious egg away from it caused Chansey to get faster at fleeing.","","Kangaskhan protects its child by keeping it in its pouch. It has zero forgiveness for those who harm its child and will beat them down.","","","Although known for their splendid tail fins, Goldeen apparently compete among themselves to see whose horn is thickest and sharpest.","Its horn spins like a drill to steadily hollow out rocks—even harder ones. The coloration of the male is more vivid.","In many places, there are folktales of stardust falling into the ocean and becoming Staryu.","Its sparkling core is called “the gem of the sea.” This core can be made into high-priced accessories that are traded in secret.","Its pantomime skills are wonderful. You may become enraptured while watching it, but next thing you know, Mr. Mime has made a real wall.","Its two sharp scythes are more than just weapons. It uses them with dexterity to dress its prey before eating.","It sways its hips to a rhythm all its own. The precise movements of Jynx living in Alola are truly wonderful.","Electricity permeates its body. It swings its arms round and round to charge up electricity before unleashing a punch.","Its entire body is burning. When it breathes, the temperature rises. When it sneezes, flames shoot out!","It gets into territorial disputes with Vikavolt. For some reason, it apparently gets along well with Heracross in Alola.","They live in groups. The one with the longest, thickest, and most-scarred horns is the boss of the herd.","In the distant past, they were fairly strong, but they have become gradually weaker over time.","It fires hyper beams in all directions, burning the surrounding area to ash. There are some regions where it's called “the deity of destruction.”","It likes swimming around with people on its back. In the Alola region, it's an important means of transportation over water.","While it can transform into anything, each Ditto apparently has its own strengths and weaknesses when it comes to transformations.","The question of why only Eevee has such unstable genes has still not been solved.","Clean, clear waters are its usual habitat. When it's about to be attacked by an invading enemy, it dives into the water to hide.","Its lungs contain an organ that creates electricity. The crackling sound of electricity can be heard when it exhales.","If it inhales deeply, that's a sign it's about to attack. Prepare to be hit by flames of over 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit!","This Pokémon was created using the cutting-edge science of 20 years ago, so many parts of it have since become obsolete.","Omanyte lived in the seas of antiquity. Its fossils have been found bearing bite marks from Archeops, so apparently Archeops preyed on it.","Its heavy shell is thought to be the reason this ancient Pokémon died out. It's apparently a distant ancestor of Octillery.","This Pokémon thrived 300 million years ago. It's said that living specimens can still be seen in a certain region—a rare sight.","Its body had begun to change so it could function on land. But it didn't adapt in time and went extinct.","Restored from DNA found in amber, this Pokémon exhibited ferocity that was greater than expected. Some casualties resulted.","It doesn't do anything other than eat and sleep. When prompted to make a serious effort, though, it apparently displays awesome power.","","","","It's still weak, so it lurks on the floor of bodies of water, eating whatever food sinks down and living a quiet life.","Lakes where Dragonair live are filled with offerings from people, because they believe this Pokémon is able to control the weather.","It flies over raging seas as if they were nothing. Observing this, a ship's captain dubbed this Pokémon “the sea incarnate.”","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Every day, it tilts its head in the same rhythm. A long time ago, people raised these Pokémon to serve as clocks.","With eyes that can see in pitch-darkness, it never lets its prey escape. Some even call it “the emperor of dark nights.”","This Pokémon is very sensitive to cold. In the warmth of Alola, it appears quite lively.","It's said that the patterns on its back are related to the stars in the night sky, but the details of that relationship remain unclear.","With threads from its mouth, it fashions sturdy webs that won't break even if you set a rock on them.","Every night, it wanders around in search of prey, whose movements it restrains by spewing threads before it bites into them with its fangs.","Its fangs are so sharp, if it bites you in the dark and sucks your blood, you won't notice any pain or realize you've been bitten.","Its two antennae glow softly to lure in prey, making it a useful Pokémon for night fishing.","When the bacteria living inside its antennae absorb Lanturn's bodily fluids, a strong luminescent effect is produced.","It still can't use electricity well. When it's surprised or excited, it discharges electricity unintentionally.","On nights with many shooting stars, they gather in packs and dance in circles. If you should see them, something good will happen!","It's always practicing its singing because it wants to improve. Even when it's asleep, it keeps singing in its dreams!","","","Although it still can't fly, its jumping power is outstanding. It jumps way up into trees and plucks the buds from the branches.","It's said that while this Pokémon has the power to predict the future, it's not powerful enough to change the future it sees.","Clothing made from Mareep's fleece is easily charged with static electricity, so a special process is used on it.","In the places on its body where fleece doesn't grow, its skin is rubbery and doesn't conduct electricity. Those spots are safe to touch.","The light from its tail can be seen from space. This is why you can always tell exactly where it is, which is why it usually keeps the light off.","","","","It's so popular with the elderly that there's a magazine devoted to this Pokémon. Fans obsess over the particular length and angle of its arms.","Although its cries sound like screams, a composer created a beautiful ballad that was influenced by the sounds.","","","","As it did more and more with its tail, its hands became clumsy. It makes its nest high in the treetops.","","","","","","Although it originally had no powers at all, people say its precognitive faculties were awakened by its need to protect itself.","This Pokémon is nocturnal. Even in total darkness, its large eyes can spot its prey clearly!","It has a weakness for shiny things. It's been known to sneak into the nests of Gabite—noted collectors of jewels—in search of treasure.","It's constantly coming up with new ideas that would change the world, but as soon as it hits upon a new idea, it forgets it.","What gives meaning to its life is surprising others. If you set your ear against the red orbs around its neck, you can hear shrieking.","","","","Motionless, it hangs from trees, waiting for its bug Pokémon prey to come to it. Its favorite in Alola is Cutiefly.","When something approaches it, it fires off fragments of its steel shell in attack. This is not a conscious action but a conditioned reflex.","It travels by digging through the ground. Diglett and Dunsparce share one another's tunnels happily.","","","It grows close to others easily and is also easily spoiled. The disparity between its face and its actions makes many young people wild about it.","While it has powerful jaws, it doesn't care for disputes, so it rarely has a chance to display their might.","","Its body is like steel. Its tough, heavy pincers are more suited to smashing enemies than grabbing them.","","It's proud of its thick horn. In Alola, its biggest rival is Vikavolt, which it's always fighting with.","They will cooperate to steal eggs from the nests of bird Pokémon, but fights break out to determine which one gets to eat the eggs.","","","","","","","The pink of Corsola that live in Alola is deep and vibrant, thanks to seas filled with nutrition.","This Pokémon clings to Mantine and shares in its prosperity. When its Mantine is attacked, Remoraid will fight alongside it!","The ink it spits when escaping is special. It contains a substance that dulls the sense of smell, so Pokémon with keen noses get lost.","It shares its food with people who are stranded. Because Delibird is omnivorous, sometimes it gives those people bug Pokémon.","Postcards and posters featuring Mantine leaping elegantly above the waves are popular souvenirs of Alola.","The wing feathers it sheds can be processed and made into knives whose sharpness is recognized by the finest chefs.","It cooperates with others skillfully. When it becomes your partner, it's very loyal to you as its Trainer and will obey your orders.","They spew flames mixed with poison to finish off their opponents. They divvy up their prey evenly among the members of their pack.","","","","AI has been installed in it. It learns various things all on its own, but it even remembers things it doesn't need to know.","","The fluid of Smeargle's tail secretions changes in the intensity of its hue as the Pokémon's emotions change.","","","When it examines things, before touching them with its hands, it makes lip contact and then diligently licks all the dirt off its lips.","When it hears the crash of thunder, Elekid's mood improves. It can be useful to record that sound and play it when Elekid's feeling down.","When flames drip from its nose, that means it has a cold. Have it lie down for a nice rest in some magma.","It produces over five gallons of milk a day. The higher the quality of the pastures it lives in, the richer and tastier its milk becomes.","Their eggs are such a delicacy that some say eating one will bring you happiness. These eggs fetch the highest prices on the market.","","","","Born underground, it eats its way through dirt to the surface, where its parents are. It doesn't deal well with the bright light it finds there.","This troublesome Pokémon can't wait to evolve, so it relieves its stress by wildly propelling itself around using compressed gas.","It wanders through the mountains seeking opponents to fight. If it finds an opponent that's not worthy, Tyranitar ignores it and wanders on.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","With its long, thin wings, it catches updrafts and flies like a glider high up into the sky.","It places small Pokémon into its spacious beak and carries them around. No one knows where it's taking them.","","","","If it's in a pinch, it will secrete a sweet liquid from the tip of its head. Syrup made from gathering that liquid is tasty on bread.","Masquerain intimidates enemies with the eyelike patterns of its eyespots. If that doesn't work, it deftly makes its escape on its set of four wings.","","","","","","","","","","","","It practices its slaps by repeatedly slapping tree trunks. It has been known to slap an Exeggutor and get flung away.","Although they enjoy comparing their strength, they're also kind. They value etiquette, praising opponents they battle.","","It moves less than an inch a year, but when it's in a jam, it will spin and drill down into the ground in a split second.","","","It digs through the ground with its hard claws and crunches down gems with its thick pointy teeth. Carbink is its favorite food.","A cunning and terrifying Pokémon, its cuteness makes opponents let down their guard—and then it swallows them whole with its huge jaws.","","","","","","Friction between the air and its fur produces static electricity. When Electrike runs, it makes a crackling sound.","Manectric can be found beneath unnatural thunderclouds. People say it can run at the same speed as lightning striking.","","","","","","","","They're such cowards that they won't hunt alone. When five or so of them get together, they suddenly turn ferocious!","People believe that carrying one of its discarded fangs will prevent mishaps at sea, so the fangs are made into accessories.","It swims along with its mouth open and swallows down seawater along with its food. It sprays excess water out of its nostrils.","They eat so many fish Pokémon that when Wailord become too numerous, fishermen have to chase them off.","","","You can tell how it's feeling by the smoke spouting from its shell. Tremendous velocity is a sign of good health.","","","Its steps are shaky and stumbling. Walking for a long time makes it feel sick.","Its jaws are strong enough to crush rocks but so heavy that it can't get up if it flips over. Sandile seize those moments as their chance.","It vibrates its wings to generate ultrasonic waves, causing its prey to faint. Then it buries the prey alive in the sand to preserve it.","By flapping their wings, Flygon cause sandstorms that conceal Krookodile. The team then splits the prey they catch.","","","","","","","","","Its entire body is gooey. When pecked at by bird Pokémon, it slips and slides its way to freedom.","Whiscash shakes the ground at high intensities to intimidate its opponents. It swallows its prey whole—along with mud from the swamp floor.","Individuals that have been set free by Trainers who could no longer raise them have become common, and they can now be found in Alola.","Its temperament is rough and it loves to fight, but as soon as its pincers break off, it turns cowardly. It stays timid until they grow back.","Depictions of Pokémon similar to Baltoy have been found on the walls of caves where primitive humans lived.","If it gets wet, its body melts. When rain starts to fall, it wraps its whole body up with its psychic powers to protect itself.","In ancient times, it lived in warm seas. It disguised itself as seaweed to ambush its prey and devoured them whole when they got close.","Normally, it lived on shallow sea shoals. When the tide went out, this Pokémon came up on land to search for prey.","When restored Anorith are released into the ocean, they don't thrive, because the water composition has changed since their era.","It lived on land and went out into the sea to hunt for prey. Its sharp claws were its greatest weapon.","They look ragged, so no one catches them. They look like they'd taste bad, so predators won't eat them. And their numbers continue to grow.","While Milotic is said to be the most beautiful Pokémon, Trainers who like Feebas and have raised it are seemingly disappointed by Milotic.","Although its form changes with the weather, that is apparently the result of a chemical reaction and not the result of its own free will.","It changes its hue to blend into its surroundings. If no one takes notice of it for too long, it will pout and never reveal itself.","It eats up emotions like malice, jealousy, and resentment, so some people are grateful for its presence.","It's a stuffed toy that was thrown away and became possessed, ever searching for the one who threw it away so it can exact its revenge.","","","The bunches of fruit growing around the necks of Tropius in Alola are especially sweet compared to those in other regions.","","The only thing unlucky about Absol is its appearance. It protects fields and warns people of disaster, so one ought to be grateful for it.","","It feeds mainly on ice and snow. It's only able to survive in a limited number of places in the warm Alola region.","It freezes its prey and chews them whole. However, it prefers to eat Pokémon like Vanillite that are already frozen.","","","","Despite its appearance, it's carnivorous. It clamps down on its prey with both sides of its shell and doesn't let go until they stop moving.","It's not the strongest swimmer. It wags its tail to lure in its prey and then gulps them down as soon as they get close.","The color of its body changes with the water temperature. The coloration of Gorebyss in Alola is almost blindingly vivid.","Thought to have gone extinct, Relicanth was given a name that is a variation of the name of the person who discovered it.","There was an era when it was overfished due to the rumor that having one of its heart-shaped scales would enable you to find a sweetheart.","Whenever it sees bird Pokémon flying through the sky, it becomes envious and smashes its surroundings to bits with headbutts.","The cells within its body are changing at a bewildering pace. Its hard shell is made from the same substance as bone.","Overjoyed at finally being able to fly, it flies all over the place and usually doesn't land until it's completely exhausted and needs to sleep.","Instead of blood, magnetism flows through its body. When it's feeling bad, try giving it a magnet.","With its two brains, it fires powerful psychic energy to stop its prey in their tracks.","It boasts not only psychic powers but also fantastic strength. It grabs its prey with its four legs and holds them in place with its claws.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","A primeval Pokémon, it possesses a hard and sturdy skull, lacking any intelligence within.","In ancient times, people would dig up fossils of this Pokémon and use its skull, which is harder than steel, to make helmets.","A mild-mannered, herbivorous Pokémon, it used its face to dig up tree roots to eat. The skin on its face was plenty tough.","The bones of its face are huge and hard, so they were mistaken for its spine until after this Pokémon was successfully restored.","","","","","","","","","","","While they normally live in the sea, they can function on land, too, until their skin dries out.","Long ago, it had a shell on its back. There's now a vestigial plate on its back that's hard but thin.","In their search for comfortable trees, they get into territorial disputes with groups of Passimian. They win about half the time.","Its round body is stuffed with souls and expands each time it leads someone away.","There's a rumor that if you catch a Drifblim floating on the wind at dusk, you'll be carried away to the afterlife.","Its arms and legs are weak, but when it rolls its ears up tight and then unleashes them with its full force, it can smash boulders to dust.","Lopunny regrows its coat twice a year. Mufflers and hats made from its fur are really warm.","Feared for its wrath and the curses it spreads, this Pokémon will also, on a whim, cast spells that help people.","It will absolutely not forgive failure from or betrayal by its goons. It has no choice in this if it wants to maintain the order of the flock.","","","","","","","","It discharges moisture from its eyes, making it look like it's crying—apparently an effective way of getting enemies to let down their guard.","It does its absolute best to mimic the movements and expressions of its opponents, but it's still not very good at it.","Usually it's a well-behaved Pokémon, but if you take its round rock away, it will cry and fuss and throw a big old tantrum.","","","It reacts to anything that moves—flies right at it and bites it. Sometimes it injures itself, but it doesn't care too much.","It loves shiny things. When it finds a Sableye trying to catch a Carbink, Gabite becomes furiously angry and attacks the Sableye.","It flies at the speed of sound while searching for prey, and it has midair battles with Salamence as the two compete for food.","It hides food under its long fur, but it sometimes forgets about it and causes a stinky disturbance.","It knows how people and Pokémon feel by looking at their auras. It doesn't approach dangerous opponents.","It concentrates its mental energy and fires off mysterious waves called auras, which can crush boulders of large size to dust.","","","","","","","","When night falls, their pink patterns begin to shine. They're popular with divers, so there are resorts that feed them to keep them close.","Deep down at the bottom of the ocean, prey is scarce. Lumineon get into fierce disputes with Lanturn over food.","It's highly friendly and easily tamed. Tours that take people swimming with Mantyke are a super-popular beach activity.","","","One Weavile will trip a Sandshrew and flip it over, and then another Weavile will deal the finishing blow with its sharp claws.","It uses radar to monitor its territory. Intruders are quickly disposed of with a hyper beam.","A contest is under way to determine which one can stick its tongue out the farthest. The current record is...more than 82 feet.","","","It grips its tail, which spews electricity, and then beats down opponents with the power of its electrified fist.","There are still quite a few factories that rely on the flames provided by Magmortar to process metals.","","","Although it doesn't like disputes, it will sharpen the leaf on its tail into a blade and fight if it has to protect its friends.","It protects itself by freezing its fur into sharp needles. It can drop its body temperature below –75 degrees Fahrenheit.","","","Its behavior is noticeably unstable, which is apparently due to the incompetence of the engineer who updated its programming.","","Although it can control its units known as Mini-Noses, they sometimes get lost and don't come back.","","It freezes hikers who have come to climb snowy mountains and carries them back to its home. It only goes after men it thinks are handsome.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","This Pokémon has excellent judgment. If it decides it can't defeat an opponent, it immediately turns tail and vamooses.","The longer its black fur grows, the harder and more impervious it gets. Claws and fangs can't easily penetrate it.","It pays no mind to the cold, thanks to its long warm coat. Stoutland in Alola look a little uncomfortable.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","The hexagonal hole is its ear. Deep in that ear is an energy core, so if you stick your hand in there, Roggenrola will be very angry!","The energy overflowing from its body has turned into orange crystals that are hard enough to smash diamonds.","When it fires off energy with all its might, the power creates countless fissures on its body.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","To protect itself, it shoots cotton from its body. When it gets wet in the rain, its cotton grows moist and heavy, and it can't move as well.","This nuisance sneaks into people's homes, where it hides important things and scatters cotton all over the place.","Some say if you dry the leaves on its head, boil them down, and drink the infusion, your vigor will return, so Petilil is popular with the elderly.","The fragrance of its flower differs slightly depending on the soil where it grew up. Sniffing the aroma calms your heart and mind.","Savage, violent Pokémon, red and blue Basculin are always fighting each other over territory.","Alola, where it's warm all year round, is a comfortable environment for this Pokémon. Sometimes you'll even see it outside of deserts.","Krokorok really hates it when its body gets cold. On nights when the temperature drops, it digs deep into the desert sands.","When it spots prey, even at a distance of over 30 miles, it swims through the desert as if it were water, then jumps out and chomps them.","","","","","","They move in small groups, walking around lazily. Anyone who makes eye contact gets smacked with a headbutt.","This Pokémon may be rude, but it takes very good care of its family, its friends, and its turf.","","","","It was restored from an ancient fossil. Tirtouga lived in the sea but came up onto the land to search for prey.","Its jaws are terrifyingly powerful. It could eat Omastar and Omanyte whole and not be bothered in the slightest by their shells.","Once thought to be the ancestor of all bird Pokémon, some of the latest research suggests that may not be the case.","This ancient Pokémon's plumage is delicate, so if anyone other than an experienced professional tries to restore it, they will fail.","Poisonous gas leaks out of it when it breathes. Muk that catch a whiff of that stench will come drooling.","It locks opponents in place with its left hand, immobilizing them by entirely dousing their bodies with poisonous liquid.","This Pokémon has a cowardly disposition, so when it's not around friends, it basically always stays transformed as something else.","It doesn't just transform itself—it also has the power to make hundreds of people see its illusions.","A clean freak that will not allow even the slightest mess, it uses its tail like a mop to thoroughly clean any and all filth.","The white parts of its coat are covered in an oil secreted from its body, so this Pokémon can slide right away from its enemies' attacks.","","","","","","","","","It exhales cold air that is at -58 degrees Fahrenheit. When it's in a warm place, it shrinks little by little.","It sprays its enemies with grains of ice to freeze them. Most Vanillish in Alola are smaller than average.","It blasts blizzards from its two mouths. It can create snow anywhere, so it gets a lot of love from skiers and snowboarders.","","","They store up electricity to fly through the air. When thunder cracks at night, sometimes there are almost enough of them to blot out the sky.","","","","","It wraps its veillike arms and legs around prey swimming by and drags them down to the depths of the ocean.","Jellicent is always hanging around fancy cruise ships and tankers, hoping to drag away its prey.","Fishermen take them along on long voyages, because if you have an Alomomola with you, there'll be no need for a doctor or medicine.","","","","","","","","","","","It controls tremendous psychic power. Most reports of alien sightings are actually just people mistaking Elgyem for an alien.","With its psychic powers, it rewrites its opponents' memories. You, too, may have already had your memories rewritten.","","","","","","","","","","","","","They can often be seen in packs in the morning, slowly moving their bodies through a series of poses.","It overwhelms its opponents with continuous attacks and then slowly stores up power before delivering the finishing blow.","The red skin on its face is harder than rock. In narrow caves, it squares off against its enemies and charges face-first right into them.","Its movements are powered by a mysterious energy. It has continued to move since ancient times, so its power may soon run out.","Some say that ancient people invented Golurk to serve as a laborer. It follows its master's orders faithfully.","After shredding its prey, it sharpens its blades on a stone by the river.

It can even smash thick walls of ice to bits!","It wins the hearts of its enemies with its passionate dancing and then uses the opening it creates to burn them up with blazing flames.","Nectar and pollen are its favorite fare. In fields of flowers, it gets into skirmishes with Butterfree over food.","Rain makes pollen damp, so Ribombee hates rain. When it sees ominous clouds, it finds a hollow in a tree, where it waits stock-still.","As they develop, their disposition grows more violent and aggressive. Many Trainers find them too much to handle and abandon them.","The sharp rocks in its mane can cut like knives. Lycanroc wears its prey down by degrees before finishing them off.","They're weak, so they move in schools. However, they can also often be seen all alone, having strayed from the school.","They eat Corsola branches, so Mareanie are hated by craftsmen who work with Corsola branches that have naturally fallen off.","To attack, this Pokémon sends toxic spikes flying at its enemies. Ones that come close get mown down by the claws on its feet.","It loves playing in the mud.
