var fdataPokédexEntry = ["","","","","","","","","","Its body is soft and weak. In nature, its perpetual fate is to be seen by others as food.","Its hard shell doesn't crack a bit even if Pikipek pecks at it, but it will tip over, spilling out its insides.","Nectar from pretty flowers is its favorite food. In fields of flowers, it has heated battles with Cutiefly for territory.","","","","","","","This Pokémon is common but hazardous. Its sharp incisors can easily cut right through hard wood.","Its whiskers are essential for maintaining its balance. No matter how friendly you are, it will get angry and bite you if you touch its whiskers.","Due to its short wings, it can't fly long distances. It wanders about restlessly and pecks at bug Pokémon.","In Alola, fish Pokémon are its prey. It can be seen circling above the ocean searching for food.","The eggs of bird Pokémon are its favorite food. It swallows eggs whole, so sometimes an egg gets stuck, and Ekans faints.","After stunning its opponents with the pattern on its stomach, it quickly wraps them up in its body and waits for them to stop moving.","While sleeping, it generates electricity in the sacs in its cheeks. If it's not getting enough sleep, it will be able to use only weak electricity.","Because so many Trainers like the way Pikachu looks, you don't see this Pokémon very often.","When its skin gets wrinkled from moisture, it heads for a volcano. It lies flat on a spot with a lot of geothermal heat and dries itself out.","Thanks to its thick claws, it's good at climbing trees. There are plenty of Sandslash that park themselves in trees and go right to sleep.","","","","","","","Bathed in moonlight, its wings glow faintly. Without even flapping, Clefairy rises into the air, where it dances around.","Some scientists believe that it gazes intently at the sky on nights with a full moon because it's homesick.","It manipulates balls of fire to catch its prey. If you raise one from when it's young, it will grow close to you like a puppy Pokémon.","The flickering flames it spews from its mouth leave its opponents hypnotized. Then, this extremely intelligent Pokémon attacks.","The songs they sing are totally different depending on the region they live in. Some even sound like they're shouting!","When it gets angry, it inhales with all its might, and its body gradually inflates. Sometimes they can grow 20 times larger!","Their skin is so thin that they'll be burned if sunlight hits them. When it gets cold out, they gather together to warm one another's bodies.","They can suck down over 10 ounces of blood in one go. They have been known to drink so much blood that they can no longer fly.","","","","The mushrooms, known as tochukaso, are controlling the bug. Even if the bug bugs the mushrooms, they tell it to bug off.","Its poisonous spores are also used in traditional medicine. Apparently, spores produced in Alola are not of very good quality.","","","Around their crops, farmers plant the kind of tree that Diglett like to eat as a way of getting Diglett to plow the fields for them.","Dugtrio's heads are sleek and smooth and incredibly hard. It can dig through any soil with its headbutts.","It loves coins, so if you give it one, you can make friends with Meowth easily. But it's fickle, so you can't count on that friendship lasting.","This Pokémon is popular with rich people. It's also targeted by hunters who are after the jewel in its forehead.","It has been found that its brain cells are 10 times more active when Psyduck is experiencing a headache.","A professional swimmer, it can continue swimming for two days straight by waving its long tail skillfully.","If one gets angry, all the others around it will get angry, so silence is a rare visitor in a troop of Mankey.","The blood vessels in its brain are sturdier than those of other Pokémon, so it can stay healthy despite its constant raging.","It has lived alongside humans since ages ago. Its bones have been found in excavations of ruins from the Stone Age.","There are so many old tales about them that they're called legendary Pokémon, but there are way more of them around than you'd expect.","The direction of the swirl on their stomachs differs depending on where they live. Poliwag aficionados can tell them apart at a glance.","Its health suffers when its skin dries out, so be sure to moisturize it diligently.","The muscles it has developed through swimming are thick and powerful. When it lands a square punch, it can turn huge boulders to dust.","It can read others' minds and will teleport away when danger approaches. You must clear your mind if you want to catch it.","It possesses strong mental capabilities, but its psychic powers are halved when it's not holding a silver spoon.","If it trusts someone deeply, it will let them have one of its spoons. Anything you eat with that spoon is apparently delicious.","It likes food that's highly nutritious because its instincts drive it to build muscle efficiently.","A popular motif for sculptures, its incredibly well-developed muscles have captured the imagination of many an artist.","With four arms, it can attack and defend simultaneously. It's said to have mastered every martial art in the world.","","","","Its body is 99% water. The remaining 1% contains the organ that makes its poison.","It communicates with others of its kind by lighting up the red orbs on its head. When the orbs are blinking, it's a warning sign.","It uses both hands to climb precipitous cliffs. People who see it in action have been known to take up bouldering.","It travels by rolling down cliffs. If it falls into a river, it will explode with its last gasp.","It detonates its own body. The power from that explosion can propel it up steep mountain paths with amazing speed.","","","Although their tails, which fall off naturally, can easily be found lying around, they're a precious ingredient for cooking.","Shellder, in its greed to suck out more and more sweetness from Slowbro's tail, has metamorphosed into a spiral-shaped shell.","Perhaps because electrical lines are often buried these days, the number of Magnemite attacks on power plants has increased.","When rain clouds form, many Magneton gather in high places to wait for lightning to strike.","","","","Thanks to its thick fat, cold seas don't bother it at all, but it gets tired pretty easily in warm waters.","It sunbathes on the beach after meals. The rise in its body temperature helps its digestion.","The wastewater coming from factories is clean these days, so Grimer have nothing to eat. They're said to be on the verge of extinction.","Because they scatter germs everywhere, they've long been targeted for extermination, leading to a steep decline in their population.","Even when its shell is closed, its tongue still hangs out. If you give its tongue a good yank, the shock will cause Shellder to open its shell.","Slowpoke tails are its favorite food. It has even been known to come up on land to look for Slowpoke from time to time.","Poisonous gas comprises 95% of its body. It's said that the remaining 5% is made up of the souls of those who died from the gas.","It's dangerous to go outside alone on nights when you're feeling sad. Haunter will catch you, and you won't be able to go back home.","Even your home isn't safe. Gengar will lurk in whatever dark corner of a room it can find and wait for its chance to catch its prey.","","It puts its prey to sleep and devours their dreams. It seems that bad dreams taste sour, so Drowzee doesn't particularly like eating them.","There are some Hypno that assist doctors with patients who can't sleep at night in hospitals.","","","","","Although they are the same size as other Exeggcute, the ones produced in Alola are quite heavy. Their shells are packed full.","Each of its three heads has its own thoughts. When they want to go in different directions, Exeggutor becomes unable to move.","It wears its mother's skull on its head, so no one knows what its bare face looks like. However, it's clear that it's always crying.","They thump their bones rhythmically to communicate among themselves. There are nearly 50 different rhythmic patterns.","","","It licks filth clean with its tongue. Whatever it licks always stinks afterward, so whether it's really clean is...questionable.","","","","","Because the eggs on their bellies have been overharvested by people in the past, the Chansey population remains very small.","","You shouldn't get close to the child when it's playing outside its mother's pouch. Its mother is always nearby watching over it.","","","The way it swims along fluttering its dress-like fins has earned it the name “princess of the water.”","To attract females, males dance on the river's floor. The females gather around the male that dances most gracefully.","No number of injuries can bother Staryu. Its amazing regenerative powers return it to its previous state in half a day!","It rotates its geometrically shaped body to swim through the water. It always seems to be sending out mysterious radio waves.","It creates invisible walls with its pantomiming. If you don't act impressed, it will attack you with a double slap!","Some call it a ninja. Its movements— imperceptibly quick—are sufficient to cleave the air in two. It's very popular in Alola.","Its strange cries sound like human language. There are some musicians who compose songs for Jynx to sing.","While it's often blamed for power outages, the truth is the cause of outages is more often an error on the part of the electric company.","The hotter the place, the better they feel. Magmar in Alola are said to be hardier than those in other areas.","Although it's tough, it can't handle cold well. When night falls, it buries itself in leafage and sleeps.","The climate seems to be related to the reason Tauros in Alola are a little calmer than those in other regions.","Thanks to their strong hold on life, dirty water doesn't bother them at all. They live in waters all over the world!","The energy from evolution stimulated its brain cells strongly, causing it to become very ferocious.","They've been so cherished that there's now an overabundance. The fish Pokémon population has declined in waters with too many Lapras.","It transforms into whatever it sees. If the thing it's transforming into isn't right in front of it, Ditto relies on its memory—so sometimes it fails.","Its genes are easily influenced by its surroundings. Even its face starts to look like that of its Trainer.","It detects nearby moisture with its fin. When its fin begins trembling rapidly, that means rain will fall in a few hours.","Its fur stands on end, becoming like needles it fires at enemies. Once they're weakened, it finishes them off with a 10,000 volt shock.","The flame chamber inside its body ignites when Flareon gets agitated, reaching temperatures of up to 1,650 degrees Fahrenheit.","It was built 20 years ago by scientists who dreamed of exploring space. Their dreams have yet to come true.","It was restored from an ancient fossil. Those Helix Fossils are excavated from areas that were once oceans long, long ago.","It wraps its prey in its tentacles to immobilize them and then finishes them off with its sharp fangs.","This Pokémon became extinct everywhere, except in a few areas. It protects itself with its hard shell.","It swims at speeds of roughly 29 knots, quickly closing in on its prey and slashing into them with its scythes to finish them off.","It flew through the open skies over the ancient continent as if they were its own. When it touched ground, its walk was weak and slow.","It has no interest in anything other than eating. Even if you climb up on its stomach while it's napping, it doesn't seem to mind at all!","","","","It sheds its skin—almost on a daily basis—and grows larger. Its skin is soft just after it's been shed.","Some say that if you see it at the start of the year, flying through the sky and twisting its body, you'll be healthy all year long.","You'll often hear tales of this kindhearted Pokémon rescuing people or Pokémon that are drowning.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","It cries out at the same time every day. A long time ago, people cherished it and considered it a divine messenger sent to tell the time.","When it turns its head entirely upside down, you know it's troubled by something. If you don't leave it be, it will peck you.","These very cowardly Pokémon join together and use Reflect to protect their nest.","It flies through the night sky, sprinkling sparkly dust. According to some, if that dust sticks to you, good things will happen to you.","Although the poison from its fangs isn't that strong, it's potent enough to weaken prey that gets caught in its web.","It spews threads from its mouth to catch its prey. When night falls, it leaves its web to go hunt aggressively.","It feeds on the blood of living people and Pokémon. If it can't drink any blood for even a short while, it becomes weak and unable to fly.","Chinchou blink their shining antennae at one another to claim their respective turf.","It lives far down in the depths of the ocean. It blinds its prey with light, using the moment they're dazzled to swallow them whole.","It has electric sacs in its cheeks. When they're fully charged, Pichu plays very energetically.","Said to have ridden here on a shooting star, Cleffa seem to appear in places where meteorites have struck in the past.","Left to its own devices, it will constantly practice singing. You should make it take a break so it doesn't hurt its throat.","","","The look in its eyes gives the impression that it's carefully observing you. If you approach it, Natu will hop away.","While it can see the future, it has no desire to change it, which is probably why it remains motionless at all times.","Rubbing its fleece generates electricity. You'll want to pet it because it's cute, but if you use your bare hand, you'll get a painful shock.","It stores electricity in its fluffy fleece. If it stores up too much, it will start to go bald in those patches.","Its tail shines bright and strong. It has been prized since long ago as a beacon for sailors.","","","","The result of its holding the same pose all the time is arms that have become supple yet strong.","The longer and more luxurious the curled hair on its head, the greater the number of Poliwag and Poliwhirl that will obey it.","","","","It searches for prey from the tops of trees. When it spots its favorite food, Bounsweet, Aipom gets excited and pounces.","","","","","","Psychic power builds up in the orb on its forehead as it bathes in the sunshine. Espeon is not good at battling at night.","It lurks in the dark of night looking for prey. At the moment it pounces, the rings on its body glow dimly but ominously.","It searches for shiny things for its boss. Murkrow's presence is said to be unlucky, so many people detest it.","It's called "the sage of the sea." It engages in battles of wits with Oranguru, but the result is usually a draw.","What makes it happy is imitating the voices of weeping people and scaring everyone. It doesn't deal well with folks who aren't easily frightened.","","","","It sticks tree bark to itself with its saliva, making itself thicker and larger. Elderly Pineco are ridiculously huge.","In the moment that it gulps down its prey, the inside of its shell is exposed, but to this day, no one has ever seen that sight.","When it sees a person, it digs a hole with its tail to make its escape. If you happen to find one, consider yourself lucky.","","","In contrast to its appearance, it's quite timid. When playing with other puppy Pokémon, it sometimes gets bullied.","Although it's popular with young people, Granbull is timid and sensitive, so it's totally incompetent as a watchdog.","","Once it has identified something as an enemy, it will continue beating them with its steel-hard pincers until there's nothing left but scraps.","","It roams through forests searching for sweet nectar. Although it boasts fantastic physical strength, it's not that good at flying.","It blends into the dark of night to ambush its prey. Sneasel will attack Sandshrew, but its hard skin can cause Sneasel's claws to snap off.","","","","","","","In Alola, where their natural enemies Mareanie are plentiful, many Corsola have stubby branches on their heads.","Also known as the "sniper of the seas," its water gun can hit prey without fail from over 300 feet away.","It usually sleeps in caves. The pitch-black ink that Octillery spits is also used for cooking.","It wraps food in its tail to carry it around. The Delibird with the biggest tail is the boss of the flock!","Many people have taken up surfing because they admire how magnificently Mantine swims.","Its body is draped in steel armor. It looks heavy, but it can fly at speeds of up to 185 miles an hour!","They make repeated eerie howls before dawn to call attention to their pack.","Identifiable by its eerie howls, people a long time ago thought it was the grim reaper and feared it.","","","","Even though it doesn't die in the vacuum of space, it can't move around very well in zero gravity.","","It draws symbols with the fluid that oozes from the tip of its tail. Depending on the symbol, Smeargle fanatics will pay big money for them.","","","Highly perceptive sensors, Smoochum's lips are kept moist by its daily application of tree sap.","When its horns shine a bluish white, that's the sign it's fully charged. You'll get a shocking jolt if you touch it!","Its body temperature is always around 1,100 degrees Fahrenheit. If Magby falls into a small- enough pond, the whole thing will dry up.","Its milk is delicious and chock-full of nutrients. However, if you drink too much, it could make your stomach hurt, so be careful.","This Pokémon is overflowing with love. Only Chansey that share a strong bond with their Trainer can evolve, so people say.","","","","Raised on nutrients it finds in the dirt, it eats roughly a mountain's worth of dirt before it becomes a pupa.","This dangerous pupa thrashes about. Its shell is as hard as bedrock, containing its gradually forming new body within.","This Pokémon is a mobile disaster, leaving mountains crumbled and houses destroyed in its wake.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","It builds nests in cliffs by the sea. It circles the skies above the ocean looking for its favorite food—Wishiwashi.","It scoops up Wishiwashi in its huge beak and swallows them whole. It can devour more than 30 at one go!","","","","It lives in ponds and marshes that feature lots of plant life. It often fights with Dewpider, whose habitat and diet are similar.","Its thin, winglike antennae are highly absorbent. It waits out rainy days in tree hollows.","","","","","","","","","","","","There's a rumor of a traditional recipe for stew that Trainers can use to raise strong Makuhita.","Hariyama that are big and fat aren't necessarily strong. There are some small ones that move nimbly and use moves skillfully.","","It hunts without twitching a muscle by pulling in its prey with powerful magnetism. But sometimes it pulls natural enemies in close.","","","Materials from gems it has eaten float to the surface of its body and can form an infinite number of patterns among individuals.","It has two mouths. The big jaws on the back of its head can't taste anything, so that's the mouth it uses to eat foods it doesn't like.","","","","","","Static electricity builds up all over its body as strands of its long fur rub together. This Pokémon boasts incredible speed.","It stimulates its own muscles with electricity, so it can move quickly. It eases its soreness with electricity, too, so it can recover quickly as well.","","","","","","","","With its sturdy jaws and fangs, it can easily chomp wooden boats to splinters. It fights with Basculin over food.","It drinks in seawater and jets it from its rear to propel itself. It's very sensitive to the scent of blood.","Due to their memories of when they once lived on land, pods of them will, very rarely, wash up on shore.","When a small Wailmer is attacked by Sharpedo or Dhelmise, its whole pod works together to protect it.","","","It burns coal to produce energy. When it has burned through all of its coal, it becomes unable to move.","","","Each Spinda's spot pattern is different. With its stumbling movements, it evades opponents' attacks brilliantly!","It builds nests that double as traps, lying in wait for its prey to get caught. When night falls, it digs itself a spot beneath the sand to sleep.","It vibrates its wings to send out odd sound waves. Trainers who are with it need earplugs.","People continue to have their hearts stolen by its enchanting songs and find themselves stranded in the desert.","","","","","","","","","Its whiskers are filled with nerves. They can sense smells and flavors just as a person's nose or tongue would.","Its vision is not that good. It senses vibrations in the water with its whiskers to determine the location of its prey.","It can adapt very well to its environment. Feebas and Corphish are about the only Pokémon to live in stagnant ditches.","Its pincers often fall off. Unlike with Crabrawler or Clauncher, the meat in its claws is utterly nasty and stinking.","When they find others of their kind, they cry out loudly and gather together. Large numbers of them can be found in old graveyards.","The ancient people who made it apparently modeled it after something that descended from the sky. It fires beams from both arms.","It sticks to rocks with its powerful suckers and can't be washed away no matter how rough the surf gets.","This carnivorous Pokémon lived in primordial seas. It catches prey in its eight tentacles and dissolves them with digestive fluid as it eats.","This is one kind of primeval bug Pokémon. With eight wings, it could apparently swim a lot faster than you'd expect.","Armaldo adapted from living in water to living on land. It has been determined that it is the ancestor of some bug Pokémon.","Because of its wretched appearance, most people pay it no attention, but there are some who collect Feebas—and Feebas alone!","Its dwelling place is the bottom of big lakes. Those who behold its loveliness are said to have their hearts purified.","Its form changes depending on the weather. The rougher conditions get, the rougher Castform's disposition!","Its color changes for concealment and also when its mood or health changes. The darker the color, the healthier it is.","There's a proverb that says, “Shun the house where Shuppet gather in the growing dusk.”","Resentment at being cast off made it spring into being. Some say that treating it well will satisfy it, and it will once more become a stuffed toy.","","","Bunches of delicious fruit grow around its neck. In warm areas, many ranches raise Tropius.","","The elderly call it the disaster Pokémon and detest it, but interest in its power to predict disasters is on the rise.","","Rich people from cold areas all share childhood memories of playing with Snorunt.","Its actual body is a rock that isn't particularly hard. Glalie absorbs moisture from the air and drapes itself in an armor of ice.","","","","Clamperl's pearls are exceedingly precious. They can be more than 10 times as costly as Shellder's pearls.","Deep seas are their habitat. According to tradition, when Huntail wash up onshore, something unfortunate will happen.","It sucks bodily fluids out of its prey. The leftover meat sinks to the seafloor, where it becomes food for other Pokémon.","The reason it hasn't changed at all in a hundred million years is that it's apparently already a perfect life-form.","Luvdisc makes its home in coral reefs in warm seas. It especially likes sleeping in the space between Corsola's branches.","Some theories suggest that its behavior of forcefully bashing its head into things stimulates cells that affect its evolution.","Shelgon lives deep within caves. It stays shut up in its hard shell, dreaming of the day it will be able to fly.","Thanks to its fervent wishes, the cells in its body finally mutated, and at last it has its heart's desire—wings.","If you anger it, it will do more than rampage. It will also burst out strong magnetism, causing nearby machines to break.","It flies at high speeds around the skies. When it finds its prey, Metang takes a firm grip with its sharp claws and never lets go.","It analyzes its opponents with more accuracy than a supercomputer, which enables it to calmly back them into a corner.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Its hard skull is its distinguishing feature. It snapped trees by headbutting them, and then it fed on their ripe berries.","This ancient Pokémon used headbutts skillfully. Its brain was really small, so some theories suggest that its stupidity led to its extinction.","Although its fossils can be found in layers of primeval rock, nothing but its face has ever been discovered.","This Pokémon is from roughly 100 million years ago. Its terrifyingly tough face is harder than steel.","","","","","","","","","","","When it senses danger, a purple liquid oozes out of it. The liquid is thought to be something like greasy sweat.","Their shape and color change, depending on their environment and diet. There are many of them at beaches where the waves are calm.","It uses its tails for everything. If it wraps both of its tails around you and gives you a squeeze, that's proof it really likes you.","Wandering souls gathered together to form this Pokémon. When trying to make friends with children, Drifloon grabs them by the hand.","The raw material for the gas inside its body is souls. When its body starts to deflate, it's thought to carry away people and Pokémon.","The reason it keeps one ear rolled up is so it can launch a swift counterattack if it's attacked by an enemy.","It's notably wary and has a dislike of fighting, but at the same time, it can deliver powerful kicks with its lithe legs.","Its muttered curses can cause awful headaches or terrifying visions that torment others.","Its goons take care of most of the fighting for it. The only time it dirties its own hands is in delivering a final blow to finish off an opponent.","","","","","","","","If its body gets too damp, it will die. So, in a process reminiscent of sweating, its eyes expel moisture.","When this gifted mimic surprises an opponent, Mime Jr. feels so happy that it ends up forgetting it was imitating something.","When it sees something round and white, Happiny puts it into the pouch on its stomach. It sometimes becomes overloaded and can't move.","","","Its original home is an area much hotter than Alola. If you're planning to live with one, your heating bill will soar.","It sheds its skin and gradually grows larger. Its scales can be ground into a powder and used as raw materials for traditional medicine.","Its fine scales don't just reduce wind resistance—their sharp edges also cause injury to any opponent who attacks it.","Anything that looks edible, Munchlax will go on and swallow whole. Its stomach is tough enough to handle it even if the food has gone rotten.","It uses waves called auras to communicate with others of its kind. It doesn't make any noise during this time, so its enemies can't detect it.","Lucario reads its opponent's feelings with its aura waves. It finds out things it would rather not know, so it gets stressed out easily.","","","","","","","","It lures in prey with its shining tail fins. It stays near the surface during the day and moves to the depths when night falls.","They traverse the deep waters as if crawling over the seafloor. The fantastic lights of its fins shine like stars in the night sky.","Mantyke are friendly toward people and will approach boats closely. The patterns on their backs differ depending on their habitat.","","","Thanks to its increased intelligence, scrapping over food is a thing of the past. A scratch from its claws will give you a case of frostbite!","There are still people who believe that this Pokémon came from outer space. It emanates a powerful magnetic field.","It uses its tongue much more skillfully than its hands or its feet. It can deftly pick up a single small bean with its tongue.","","","A single Electivire can provide enough electricity for all the buildings in a big city for a year.","Magmortar takes down its enemies by shooting fireballs, which burn them to a blackened crisp. It avoids this method when hunting prey.","","","It gets its nutrition from photosynthesis. It lives a quiet life deep in forests where clean rivers flow.","It can instantaneously freeze any moisture that's around it, creating ice pellets to shoot at its prey.","","","A faulty update was added to its programming. Its behavior is noticeably strange, so the experiment may have been a failure.","","It uses three small units to catch prey and battle enemies. The main body mostly just gives orders.","","It's said that on nights of terrible blizzards, it comes down to human settlements. If you hear it knocking at your door, do not open it!","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","This Pokémon is popular with beginners because it's intelligent, obedient to its Trainer's commands, and easy to raise.","It has been living with people for so long that portrayals of it can be found on the walls of caves from long, long ago.","Its fur is long and thick. A long time ago in cold regions, every household kept a Stoutland.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","It was found in a fissure in a layer of exposed rock. The material that makes up its body is dirt from several hundred years ago.","Its orange crystals are lumps of powerful energy. They're valuable, so Boldore is sometimes targeted for them.","It absorbs rays of sunlight and shoots out energy. It's usually lurking deep beneath the surface.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","When attacked, it expels cotton from its body to create a diversion. The cotton it loses grows back in quickly.","Whimsicott doesn't live in a fixed location. It floats around on whirling winds, appearing all over the place to perform its mischief.","They prefer clean water and soil. When the environment they live in turns bad, the whole bunch will up and move to a new area.","It's well liked by other Pokémon because of its beauty. The flower on its head needs constant care, or it will soon wither and rot.","When a school of Basculin appears in a lake, everything else disappears, except for Corphish and Crawdaunt. That's how violent Basculin are.","Sandile's still not good at hunting, so it mostly eats things that have collapsed in the desert. It's called “the cleaner of the desert.”","It buries some of its prey in the sand to use as emergency meals when its hunts are unsuccessful.","It conceals itself in sandstorms that Flygon whip up and waits patiently for prey to appear.","","","","","","It stretches its saggy skin up to its neck to protect itself. The saggier their skin, the more respect they garner.","It taunts its opponents by spitting. It has a certain territory that it never leaves its whole life long.","","","","Its hunting grounds encompassed a broad area, from the land to more than half a mile deep in the ocean.","Carracosta eats every last bit of the prey it catches, even the shells and bones, to further strengthen its sturdy shell.","Restored from a fossil, this ancient bird Pokémon has wings but can't yet fly.","Said to be an ancestor of bird Pokémon, the muscles it uses to flap its wings are still weak, so it needs a long runway in order to take off.","If a young Pokémon or child breathes in the toxic gas that Trubbish belches out, it could be a life-threatening situation.","Some say the reason Garbodor in Alola are a little stronger than their counterparts elsewhere is the presence of Muk, their natural enemy.","If a normally talkative child suddenly stops talking, it may have been replaced by Zorua.","If it thinks humans are going to discover its den, Zoroark shows them visions that make them wander around in the woods.","When its tail has gotten dirty from self-cleaning or from cleaning its nest, Minccino spends a whole day washing its tail in clean spring water.","The oil that seeps from its body is really smooth. For people troubled by bad skin, this oil is an effective treatment.","","","","","","","","","When the morning sun hit an icicle, it wished not to melt, and thus Vanillite was born. At night, it buries itself in snow to sleep.","This hearty Pokémon survived the Ice Age. It's incredibly popular in very hot regions.","Vanilluxe is born when two Vanillish, half-melted by the day's light, stick to each other and freeze together in the cold return of night.","","","As it flies, it scatters electricity around, so bird Pokémon keep their distance. That's why Emolga can keep all its food to itself.","","","","","Using the invisible poison spikes on its veillike arms and legs, it paralyzes its enemies and causes them to drown.","Fishermen are terrified of Jellicent. It's rumored to drag them into the sea and steal their lives away.","The reason it helps Pokémon in a weakened condition is that any Pokémon coming after them may also attack Alomomola.","","","","","","","","","","","This Pokémon is shrouded in mystery. It's said to have appeared from a UFO that fell from the sky about 50 years ago.","It has strong psychic powers. Using its fingers that flash three different colors, it controls its opponents and rewrites their memories.","","","","","","","","","","","","","They seclude themselves in the mountains and devote themselves to training. The form of their kicks and chops differs from pack to pack.","When Mienshao lets out a bizarre wail, you're in danger. A flurry of kicks and chops too fast to see is about to be unleashed!","It infiltrates tunnels that Pokémon like Diglett and Dugtrio have dug and quietly waits for prey to pass through.","Although ancient people apparently built it by working with clay, the source of its energy is unclear.","When the seal on its chest is removed, it rages indiscriminately, turning the whole town around it into a mountain of rubble.","It follows Bisharp's orders to a tee when it attacks enemies. After slashing an opponent, Pawniard clangs both of its blades together.","It leads a group of Pawniard. Bisharp doesn't even change its expression when it deals the finishing blow to an opponent.","","Known as a natural-born warrior, soon after its hatching, it will challenge its parent to a fight in order to gain their acceptance.","Known as “the hero of the skies,” this Pokémon is so proud and so brave that it will never retreat, even when it's injured.","Its healthy appetite leads to visible growth spurts.
