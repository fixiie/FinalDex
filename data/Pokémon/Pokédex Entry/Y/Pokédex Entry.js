According to legend, whoever it recognizes is destined to become king.","In the past, rather than using perfume, royal ladies carried a Spritzee that would waft a fragrance they liked.","Its scent is so overpowering that, unless a Trainer happens to really enjoy the smell, he or she will have a hard time walking alongside it.","Because it eats nothing but sweets, its fur is as sticky sweet as cotton candy.","Its sense of smell is 100 million times better than a human's, so even the faintest scent tells it about everything in the area. It's like it can see with its nose!","It flashes the light-emitting spots on its body, which drains its opponent's will to fight. It takes the opportunity to scuttle away and hide.","It lures prey close with hypnotic motions, then wraps its tentacles around it before finishing it off with digestive fluids.","They stretch and then contract, yanking their rocks along with them in bold hops. They eat seaweed that washes up on the shoreline.","Barbaracle's legs and hands have minds of their own, and they will move independently. But they usually follow the head's orders.","It looks just like rotten kelp. It hides from foes while storing up power for its evolution.","Tales are told of ships that wander into seas where Dragalge live, never to return.","Through controlled expulsions of internal gas, it can expel water like a pistol shot. At close distances, it can shatter rock.","By expelling water from the nozzle in the back of its claw, it can move at a speed of 60 knots.","The frills on either side of its head have cells that generate electricity when exposed to sunlight.","It stimulates its muscles with electricity, boosting the strength in its legs and enabling it to run 100 yards in five seconds.","Its immense jaws have enough destructive force that it can chew up an automobile. It lived 100 million years ago.","Nothing could stop this Pokémon 100 million years ago, so it behaved like a king.","This calm Pokémon lived in a cold land where there were no violent predators like Tyrantrum.","Using its diamond-shaped crystals, it can instantly create a wall of ice to block an opponent's attack.","It wraps its ribbonlike feelers around the arm of its beloved Trainer and walks with him or her.","With its wings, it controls its position in the air. It likes to attack from above, a maneuver that is difficult to defend against.","It uses its tail to absorb electricity from power plants or from outlets in houses, and then it fires the electricity from its whiskers.","It has slept underground for hundreds of millions of years since its birth. It's occasionally found during the excavation of caves.","It's covered in a slimy membrane that makes any punches or kicks slide off it harmlessly.","Its four horns are a high-performance radar system. It uses them to sense sounds and smells, rather than using ears or a nose.","It attacks with retractable horns. It throws a punch that's the equivalent of the force of a hundred pro boxers.","It never lets go of a key that it likes, so people give it the keys to vaults and safes as a way to prevent crime.","According to old tales, these Pokémon are stumps possessed by the spirits of children who died while lost in the forest.","Using its roots as a nervous system, it controls the trees in the forest. It's kind to the Pokémon that reside in its body.","It is said to carry wandering spirits to the place where they belong so they can move on.","It enwraps its prey in its hairlike arms. It sings joyfully as it observes the suffering of its prey.","Using air of -150 degrees Fahrenheit, they freeze opponents solid. They live in herds above the snow line on mountains.","The way several Bergmite huddle on its back make it look like an aircraft carrier made of ice.","Even a robust wrestler will become dizzy and unable to stand when exposed to its 200,000-hertz ultrasonic waves.","The ultrasonic waves it emits from its ears can reduce a large boulder to pebbles. It swoops out of the dark to attack.","When the horns on its head shine in seven different colors, it is said to be sharing everlasting life.","When its life comes to an end, it absorbs the life energy of every living thing and turns into a cocoon once more.","It's hypothesized that it's monitoring those who destroy the ecosystem from deep in the cave where it lives.","It can instantly create many diamonds by compressing the carbon in the air between its hands.","It gathers things it likes and passes them through its loop to teleport them to a secret place.","It expels its internal steam from the arms on its back. It has enough power to blow away a mountain.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""];
